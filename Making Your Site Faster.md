## Current Statistics
- As of the 01/01/2015, the average page size for the Top 100 websites is 1448 KB[^1]
- Top 1000 is 1889 KB[^2]
- Related to JPEGs or Flash

[^1]: [HTTP Archive: Top 100](http://httparchive.org/interesting.php?a=All&l=Jan%201%202015&s=Top100)

## [fit] What do these results say about pagesize?

---

## It tells us
- That the Top 100 sites have good developers

## We don't all do the same
- All sites on HTTP Archive on the 1st of January of this year average 1931 KB in size[^3]

---

## What should be done?
- Minimise the amount of HTTP requests
- Perform image compression
- Minify content where possible
- Strategic DOM manipulation

---

## 1. Minimise HTTP Requests
- Each additional request adds downtimes due to DNS lookups and initiating a GET request for the file
- Most browsers allow a maximum of 8 concurrent requests per unique domain name (not IP address, so use those CNAMEs)
- Concatenate, but do it wisely

---

## 2. Compress Images
- Images store unneeded comments, extra metadata colour profiles
- Use tools like ImageOptim[^4], JPEGmini[^5], and ImageAlpha[^6]
- Or use a cloud service like Kraken[^7] or EWWW IO[^8]
- Responsibly serving images can save milliseconds and make the user happier

[^8]: [EWWW IO](http://ewww.io/)

---

## 3. Minify Content
- Comments are great for dev team, but not necessary for the world to see
- Change variables from `aVeryImportantVarName` to `a` automatically
- Concatenate source files, but use CDNs for common frameworks (i.e. jQuery[^9])

## 4. DOM Manipulation
- The DOM is slow!
- Ideally search using ID or tag selectors[^10] [^11]
- Use `<canvas>` xor React for crazy-fast performance[^12]
- Combine alterations to a node into one task (if possible)[^13]

## 5. The Obvious Stuff (Surprise Slide)
- Put your `<script>` tags in the footer (or use magic)[^14]

## [fit] Is this practical to do in the real world?

---

# Yes!

---

## Personal Case Study #1
- Client with products page list - weighed in at **12.2 MB**
- Due to: no minification, bad use of images (600x600 scaled down to 200x200), dead/poorly written code
- After refactor: **2.5 MB** with optimised images and minified JS/CSS

---

## Personal Case Study #2
- JavaScript function polled every 100ms on `scroll` and `resize` events
- Before optimisation took **~7.3ms** to complete and wrote to the DOM every time
- After optimisation... **~0.3ms** to complete and only touches the DOM when necessary
